given input stereo samples named L and R, write simple chorus effect in c++
ChatGPT
Sure, here's a simple chorus effect implementation in C++ that takes in stereo samples L and R as inputs:

c++
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

const float pi = 3.14159265359f;

float lfo(float frequency, float phase) {
    return std::sin(2 * pi * frequency * phase);
}

int main() {
    const float sampleRate = 44100.0f;
    const float depth = 0.002f; // 2 milliseconds
    const float rate = 0.3f;
    const float wetLevel = 0.5f;
    const float dryLevel = 1.0f - wetLevel;
    
    float phase = 0.0f;
    float feedbackL = 0.0f;
    float feedbackR = 0.0f;
    
    // delay buffer
    const int bufferSize = (int)(sampleRate * depth);
    float bufferL[bufferSize] = { 0.0f };
    float bufferR[bufferSize] = { 0.0f };
    int writeIndex = 0;
    
    // loop over samples
    for (int i = 0; i < numSamples; ++i) {
        float inputL = L[i];
        float inputR = R[i];
        
        // calculate LFO modulation
        float mod = 1.0f + rate * lfo(0.2f, phase);
        phase += 1.0f / sampleRate;
        
        // read from delay buffer
        float delayL = bufferL[writeIndex];
        float delayR = bufferR[writeIndex];
        
        // write to delay buffer
        bufferL[writeIndex] = inputL + feedbackL;
        bufferR[writeIndex] = inputR + feedbackR;
        writeIndex = (writeIndex + 1) % bufferSize;
        
        // calculate wet and dry signals
        float wetL = delayL * mod * wetLevel;
        float wetR = delayR * mod * wetLevel;
        float dryL = inputL * dryLevel;
        float dryR = inputR * dryLevel;
        
        // output mixed signal
        float outputL = wetL + dryL;
        float outputR = wetR + dryR;
        
        // feedback
        feedbackL = outputL * 0.5f;
        feedbackR = outputR * 0.5f;
        
        // clamp to [-1, 1]
        outputL = std::clamp(outputL, -1.0f, 1.0f);
        outputR = std::clamp(outputR, -1.0f, 1.0f);
        
        // output stereo samples
        std::cout << outputL << ", " << outputR << std::endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
In this implementation, we use a simple sinusoidal LFO to modulate the delay time of a delay buffer, creating a chorus-like effect. The amount of modulation is controlled by the depth and rate parameters, while the mix of wet and dry signals is controlled by wetLevel and dryLevel. We also add feedback to the output signal to create a richer sound.

Note that this is just a basic implementation, and there are many ways to improve and customize the chorus effect, such as by adding filtering or frequency-dependent modulation.
