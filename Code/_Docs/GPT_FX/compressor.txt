given input stereo samples named L and R, write simple compressor effect in c++
ChatGPT
Sure, here's a simple compressor effect implementation in C++ that takes in stereo samples L and R as inputs:

c++
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

const float threshold = 0.5f;
const float ratio = 2.0f;
const float attackTime = 0.001f;
const float releaseTime = 0.1f;

int main() {
    const float sampleRate = 44100.0f;
    const float attackCoef = std::exp(-1 / (attackTime * sampleRate));
    const float releaseCoef = std::exp(-1 / (releaseTime * sampleRate));
    float gain = 1.0f;
    
    // loop over samples
    for (int i = 0; i < numSamples; ++i) {
        float inputL = L[i];
        float inputR = R[i];
        
        // calculate envelope
        float envelope = std::max(std::abs(inputL), std::abs(inputR));
        
        // calculate gain reduction
        float gainReduction = 1.0f;
        if (envelope > threshold) {
            gainReduction = threshold + (envelope - threshold) / ratio;
        }
        
        // apply gain smoothing
        if (gain > gainReduction) {
            gain = attackCoef * (gain - gainReduction) + gainReduction;
        } else {
            gain = releaseCoef * (gain - gainReduction) + gainReduction;
        }
        
        // apply gain to input signal
        float outputL = inputL * gain;
        float outputR = inputR * gain;
        
        // clamp to [-1, 1]
        outputL = std::clamp(outputL, -1.0f, 1.0f);
        outputR = std::clamp(outputR, -1.0f, 1.0f);
        
        // output stereo samples
        std::cout << outputL << ", " << outputR << std::endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
In this implementation, we use a simple envelope detector to measure the level of the input signal. If the envelope exceeds the threshold, we apply gain reduction to the signal based on the compression ratio. We then use exponential smoothing to smooth out the gain changes, with a faster attack time and slower release time. Finally, we apply the resulting gain to the input signal.

Note that this is just a basic implementation, and there are many ways to improve and customize the compressor effect, such as by adding more control parameters like attack and release times, or using a different gain smoothing algorithm.
