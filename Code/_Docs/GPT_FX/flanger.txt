given input stereo samples named L and R, write simple flanger effect in c++
ChatGPT
Sure, here's a simple flanger effect implementation in C++ that takes in stereo samples L and R as inputs:

c++
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

const float pi = 3.14159265359f;

float lfo(float frequency, float phase) {
    return std::sin(2 * pi * frequency * phase);
}

int main() {
    const float sampleRate = 44100.0f;
    const float depth = 0.002f; // 2 milliseconds
    const float rate = 0.3f;
    const float delayTime = 0.003f; // 3 milliseconds
    const float feedback = 0.5f;
    const float wetLevel = 0.5f;
    const float dryLevel = 1.0f - wetLevel;
    
    float phase = 0.0f;
    
    // delay buffer
    const int bufferSize = (int)(sampleRate * delayTime);
    float bufferL[bufferSize] = { 0.0f };
    float bufferR[bufferSize] = { 0.0f };
    int writeIndex = 0;
    
    // loop over samples
    for (int i = 0; i < numSamples; ++i) {
        float inputL = L[i];
        float inputR = R[i];
        
        // calculate LFO modulation
        float mod = 1.0f + rate * lfo(0.2f, phase);
        phase += 1.0f / sampleRate;
        
        // read from delay buffer
        float delayL = bufferL[writeIndex];
        float delayR = bufferR[writeIndex];
        
        // write to delay buffer
        bufferL[writeIndex] = inputL + feedback * delayL;
        bufferR[writeIndex] = inputR + feedback * delayR;
        writeIndex = (writeIndex + 1) % bufferSize;
        
        // calculate wet and dry signals
        float wetL = delayL * mod * wetLevel;
        float wetR = delayR * mod * wetLevel;
        float dryL = inputL * dryLevel;
        float dryR = inputR * dryLevel;
        
        // output mixed signal
        float outputL = wetL + dryL;
        float outputR = wetR + dryR;
        
        // clamp to [-1, 1]
        outputL = std::clamp(outputL, -1.0f, 1.0f);
        outputR = std::clamp(outputR, -1.0f, 1.0f);
        
        // output stereo samples
        std::cout << outputL << ", " << outputR << std::endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
In this implementation, we use a delay buffer to create a delayed signal that is modulated by an LFO. The amount of modulation is controlled by the depth and rate parameters, while the delay time is controlled by the delayTime parameter. We also add feedback to the delayed signal to create a more resonant sound. The mix of wet and dry signals is controlled by wetLevel and dryLevel.

Note that this is just a basic implementation, and there are many ways to improve and customize the flanger effect, such as by adding filtering or frequency-dependent modulation.
