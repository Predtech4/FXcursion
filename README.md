## Getting started

```
git clone https://github.com/Predtech4/FXcursion.git
```

We use [STM32CubeIDE][] for development. Building from command line (or other
IDEs) might be possible, but we haven't tested this yet.

Hardware designs are availible at https://github.com/RATsynthesizers/FXcursion-HW
