# FXcursion

A guitar processor based on STM32H743VITX. Currently in prototype phase.


## Getting started

```
git clone https://github.com/Predtech4/FXcursion.git
```

We use [STM32CubeIDE][] for development. Building from command line (or other
IDEs) might be possible, but we haven't tested this yet.

[STM32CubeIDE]: https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html

Hardware designs are not published yet, stay tuned for updates.
